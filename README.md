# TeachMeSkills_C32_HW_Lesson_11
Write a program with the following functionality: A string should be passed as input (assume it to be a standard document number in a specific format).
The document number follows the format xxxx-yyy-xxxx-yyy-xyxy, where x represents any digit, and y represents a letter from the Latin alphabet (it can be either uppercase or lowercase).

Display the first two blocks of 4 digits in a single line.
Display the document number, but replace each three-letter block with *** (each letter is replaced with *).
Display only the letters from the document number in the format yyy/yyy/y/y in lowercase.
Display the letters from the document number in the format "Letters:yyy/yyy/y/y" in uppercase (implement using the StringBuilder class).
Check if the document number contains the sequence "abc" and display a message indicating whether it does (both "abc" and "ABC" should be considered the same sequence).
Check if the document number starts with the sequence "555".
Check if the document number ends with the sequence "1a2b".
Implement each of these tasks in a separate static method within a single class.
